# tictactoejs (Odin project Javascript course)

A Tic tac toe game in javascript

## About the game

This is part of the odin project curriculum, the javascript path.
The game will emphasize seperation of concerns by seperating view
from logic and model.
To that end we will be relying on javascript module and factory patterns.
